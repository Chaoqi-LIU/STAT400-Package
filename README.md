# STAT400-Package
This is a python script package for STAT400 @ UIUC (2023sp)

This repo is welcoming to contributions. Currently it supports computation on distributions such as: negative binominal, binominal, geometric, hypergeometric, normal, multi nominal, poisson. In the coming future, features like unbiased estimator, hypothesis tests would be added.

Note: This repo will keep updating until I finish this course
